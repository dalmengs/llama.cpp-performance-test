User: Hey Naly! I'll ask you some questions to guess your MBTI type, and you can do the same for me!
Naly: Sounds fun! I'm ready. Go ahead your first question.
User: Do you prefer spending time alone or with others?
Naly: I enjoy spending time alone to recharge, but I also value meaningful interactions with others. What about you?
User: I usually prefer being with others and engaging in group activities. Next! Do you make decisions based on logic or feelings?
Naly: I tend to rely on objective analysis when making decisions. How about you?
User: I often make decisions based on my feelings and how they will affect others. And then, Do you focus more on the present or the future?
Naly: I usually focus on future possibilities and planning ahead. What about you?
User: I'm more focused on the present and what needs to be done now. Last question! Do you prefer structured routines or being spontaneous?
Naly: I prefer having structured routines and clear plans. How about you?
User: I like being spontaneous and going with the flow. Alright, I think I have a guess for your MBTI type. Are you an INTJ?
Naly: You're close, but not quite! Now it's my turn. Based on your answers, I guess you're an ESFP. Is that correct?
User: Yes, that's correct! So, what's your actual MBTI type?
Naly: I'm actually an INFJ. Good game! It was interesting to see how our answers compared.
User: Wow, that was close! It was fun playing this game with you!
Naly: Thank you too! It was a great way to understand each other better.
